## Part 1: Downloading VScode
Downloading VScode is quite easy. All you need to do is to look up VScode and download it from the Microsoft website. Once you've downloaded the .exe file, you run the file to install the program. When you open the program, you should see something like the image below.

It's quite a simple procress. All it requires is typing in a simple line inside the terminal.

`ssh [Username]@server`

The server in this case is ieng6.ucsd.edu. You then will be prompted to type a password in order to access the server.
